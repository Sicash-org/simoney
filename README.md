SiMoney

“Safe as houses” ;-) Please use it with a sense of irony. 

We have done this “just for a bit of cheeky fun”, so don’t expect a code update unless this dog of a coin increases wildly in use and value.  Please do use it ironically. Behind the SiMoney and SiCash.org there are decades of financial technology audit and property knowledge, that have not been used in any way to construct this currency.

When you have agreed a price to purchase a property, and you and your legal team need your property transaction to happen quickly, speed matters. Of course, if the two parties do not use crypto, no one is going to give a flying ants nest about SiMoney. 

There are 10,000,000 premine coin, which will not be dumped on the the market, but released periodically and with some thought to the people participating in the network. No really, we will. Honest.

SiMoney is a bit of fun designed to give miners (just) the option of being kinder the environment, and to be relatively fast for property transactions (and at this stage is totally untested in that market).

SiMoney does use proven (old) code which is not only faster, but arguably better for the environment than some other coins, including Bitcoin.

Some may say the code has a pedigree, SiMoney’s code is (loosely) based on open-source code released on October 7, 2011 by Charlie Lee, a Google employee who later became Engineering Director at Coinbase. The code Charlie released has been working on a live network for over 10 years.  Examples of coins based on this code include the lovable DOGE and of course, Litecoin. 

So why is SiMoney arguably (and optionally) better for the environment than some other coins?
Some other coins depend solely on a process in which miners burn electricity competing with each other in an attempt to be first to create a new block in the the blockchain. Only the one miner who gets there first, wins the reward of new coin. This means a lot of energy is waisted as electricity generated (currently mainly by a fossil fuel power stations) is burned by those many miners who lose the block creation race and achieve nothing (its like life). This wasteful model is called ‘proof of work’ (POW). Of course, a whole industry has grown around this wasteful behaviour, and many have invested heavily in infrastructure to support it (its like life).

Proof of stake (POS) is an alternative method, where people get a turn at mining coin rather than all competing against each other (hooray?). 

SiMoney encourages miners not abuse the environment (quite so much) by giving them more rewards (currently valueless coin) for POS than POW.
