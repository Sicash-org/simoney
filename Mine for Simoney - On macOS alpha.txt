Double tap on the mounted disk image.

("SiMoney" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.)
Select the 'Cancel' button.

Then go to 'System Preferances' and click on the 'Security & Privacy' icon to show the 'General' tab.

At the bottom of the 'General' tab you will see: "SiMoney" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer. 

Click on the 'Open Anyway' button beside it, then macOS will display a final warning specifically
in relation to "SiMoney", if you wish to use the wallet on macOS you will need to click 'Open'.
From recent testing it was found that this message will only occour once the first time you attempt to start the wallet. 
However, it may occour again from time to time. 

Go back to your terminal and execute the following command to mine your first block:

./mine.sh
